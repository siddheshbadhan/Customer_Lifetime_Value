Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## Background: Customer Lifetime Value
In marketing, customer lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime customer value (LCV), or life-
time value (LTV) is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with
a customer. Customer lifetime value can also be defined as the dollar value of a customer
relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer
relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift
their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships.
Customer lifetime value is an important number because it represents an upper limit on
spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating
payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.
